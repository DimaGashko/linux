# Icon-fonts

To create icons I just use icomoon. Here's just set of icons, icomoon files and
script to install the font on my system. So I can build the font with icomoon
install it and use the icons from it with polybar, i3 and other system things where's no ability to use real images for icons (i.e. everywhere on linux)
