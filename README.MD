# My linux configuration

This repo contains my main configs I use for i3 (wm), polybar and other system
things; scripts, icons and everything else I use on my system.

> **Disclaimer**. This repo was created just to be safe by storing all main
configs on github and to use git features as well. Everything here was created
to use only on my system, so if you want to use something from this repo you
should optimize it for your needs.
