# My linux configuration

This repo contains my main configs, scripts, icons and everything else
I use with i3 (wm), polybar and other system things.

> **Disclaimer**. This repo was created just to be safe by storing all my
main configs on github, to use other git features and to have everything in one place. Everything here was created to use only on my system, so if you want
to use something from this repo you should optimize it for your own needs.
